An argument that AI training on data constitutes fair use can be analogized from the Google Books case, as discussed in the provided context:\n\n1. The Google Books case held that Google's copying of copyrighted books for the purpose of creating a searchable index was a fair use. The court emphasized that Google used the content \"in a distinct and different context,\" and \"only insofar as needed\" to achieve a new purpose (pdfs/2023_Warhol_Abridged.pdf).\n\n2. The court rejected the argument that Google's use harmed the copyright holders' market, noting that the use was transformative and did not substitute for the original works (pdfs/2015_Authors.pdf).\n\n3. The ultimate goal of copyright, as noted in the Google Books case, is to \"expand public knowledge and understanding,\" which is served by providing access and facilitating new uses of existing works (pdfs/2015_Authors.pdf).\n\nApplying these principles to AI training:\n\n- AI training involves copying copyrighted works to create a model that serves a different function than the original works, similar to how Google used books to create a search function. This is a \"distinct and different context\" that is transformative.\n\n- Like Google Books, AI training does not provide a substitute for the original works but enables new functionalities, such as generating text or answering questions.\n\n- The use is \"only insofar as needed\" to train the model, reflecting a limited, purposeful use.\n\n- The transformative nature expands knowledge and innovation, aligning with copyright\u2019s constitutional objective.\n\nTherefore, based on the Google Books fair use analysis, AI training on copyrighted data is similarly a fair use.\n\n(Sources: pdfs/2015_Authors.pdf; pdfs/2023_Warhol_Abridged.pdf)", "sources": ["pdfs/2015_Authors.pdf", "pdfs/2023_Warhol_Abridged.pdf", "pdfs/2015_Authors.pdf"], "response_time": 6.238964796066284, "cost_info": {"tokens": {"input": 1373, "output": 356, "total": 1729}, "cost": {}}}, {"role": "user", "content": "but what about the fact that it is possible to reproduce entire articles? can you rebut that?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes. The concern that AI training may enable reproduction of entire articles can be rebutted by emphasizing the following points from the provided context:\n\n1. From pdfs/NYT_OpenAI_2025.pdf:\n- Although the GPT models can output near-verbatim copies of some works when specifically prompted, such regurgitations are not typical or allowed user activity, and the models are designed to resist such reproduction.\n- \"We regard The New York Times\u2019 misuse [of the system to induce regurgitations] as not typical or allowed user activity, and is not a substitute for The New York Times.\"\n- The company has implemented opt-out mechanisms and continually improves model safeguards to prevent unauthorized copying and derivative works.\n\n2. From pdfs/2015_Authors.pdf:\n- The fair use doctrine recognizes that some quotation or limited copying may be necessary to test accuracy or rely on factual content, especially in factual works.\n- The Supreme Court has indicated that secondary authors are not at liberty to copy extensively from protected expression merely because the material is factual, highlighting the importance of context and purpose.\n\n3. Analogously, in the Google Books case, while snippets and excerpts were shown, the entire books were not made available, and the use was transformative and limited in scope.\n\nThus, even though AI models can reproduce portions of copyrighted works, such reproduction is generally limited, incidental, and controlled. The purpose of training is transformative\u2014creating a new tool and knowledge base\u2014not wholesale copying or substitution. Moreover, safeguards and opt-out options further mitigate risks of infringement.\n\n(Sources: pdfs/NYT_OpenAI_2025.pdf; pdfs/2015_Authors.pdf)", "sources": ["pdfs/NYT_OpenAI_2025.pdf", "pdfs/NYT_OpenAI_2025.pdf", "pdfs/2015_Authors.pdf"], "response_time": 13.86281704902649, "cost_info": {"tokens": {"input": 1785, "output": 335, "total": 2120}, "cost": {}}}]
